Patient Record Management System (AVL Tree Based)
This project is a Python-based application designed to manage patient records using an AVL Tree (Adelson-Velsky and Landis Tree) data structure. The system ensures efficient data retrieval and modification while maintaining a balanced tree structure. It also features a custom persistent storage system that saves the state of records to disk with timestamped filenames, allowing for data integrity checks and version rollback.
1. The Core Engine: Self-Balancing AVL TreeAt the heart of the system is an AVL Tree, a specialized Binary Search Tree (BST) that eliminates the performance pitfalls of standard trees.Why it matters: Standard trees can become "skewed" (looking like a linked list) making data retrieval slow ($O(n)$). This system guarantees $O(\log n)$ speed for every operation, regardless of data insertion order.Mechanism: It uses Left and Right Rotations to automatically rebalance the tree whenever the height difference between sub-trees exceeds 1.2. The Vault: "Blockchain-Style" PersistenceThe project distinguishes itself with a robust, file-based storage system that mimics version control and blockchain integrity.Immutable Ledger: Every Add, Update, or Remove operation creates a new, timestamped file (e.g., 02-10-2025...). The current state is never overwritten; it is appended to history.Tamper Evidence: The system utilizes SHA-256 Hashing. It hashes the current tree state and stores it. On loading, it recalculates the hash—if the file was manually edited in Notepad, the hashes won't match, and the system flags the corruption.Time Travel (Rollback): Because every state is saved as a discrete snapshot, the system can revert to any previous point in time, verifying the integrity of every file in the chain during the process.3. Functional Workflow (CRUD)The system operates on a clear Input-Process-Output cycle centered on the Patient ID:Add: Injects a new node containing ID, Name, Status, and Diseases. The tree immediately balances itself.Search: traversing the tree using the ID to instantly locate records.**Update:**Locates a node, modifies attributes (e.g., changing "Is Cured" to True), and saves a new state snapshot.Remove: Deletes the node and rebalances the tree to close the gap.4. Architectural MapThe codebase is separated into three logical layers:The Controller (src/main.py): The user interface layer. It accepts CLI commands and orchestrates the flow between the user and the backend logic.The Logic Layer (src/avl_tree.py): Pure algorithmic logic. Handles the math of node height, balance factors, and tree rotations.The Persistence Layer (src/persistent_data_func.py): The I/O manager. Handles writing to disk, reading history, generating SHA-256 hashes, and executing rollbacks.
